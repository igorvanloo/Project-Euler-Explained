Project Euler Problem 407

a^2 â‰¡ a (mod n) -> a^2 - a = 0 (mod n) -> a(a-1) = 0 (mod n)

That means that a(a - 1) is a multiple of n.
Therefore if x is a divisor of n, then either a or a-1 is a multiple of x, or equivalently

a = 0 mod x or a = 1 mod x, and therefore with another divisors n/x we have the opposite a = 0 mod n/x or a = 1 mod n/x

I noticed that if one divisor is a multiple of another then the CRT is unsolvable, furthermore I notice that if the 2 divisors
are not co-prime then the CRT is unsolvable 

Why is this the case?

Clearly if gcd(m_1, m_2) = 1 and m_1 * m_2 = n => a = 0 mod m_1 and a = 1 mod m_2

We need to prove the converse

a = 0 mod m_1 and a = 1 mod m_2, then CRT requires gcd(m_1, m_2) = 1 because of bezouts identity to form a solution!
