Project Euler Problem 

First notice that if we have x$

if we get a heads then tails we have x*(1 + 2f)*(1 - f)
If we get a tails then heads we have x*(1 - f)*(1 + 2f)
Essentially it doesn't matter in with order we win
Therefore our total winnings afetr the game is (1 + 2f)^h(1 - f)^(1000-h), where h represents the number of heads we got

My function find_f() confirms wolframalpha value f â‰ˆ 0.146883922440941..., which would take 431.26 heads to reach a billion

we need atleast 432 heads to reach one billion therefore the solution is sum h = 432 to 1000 of 1000Ch/2^1000
