Project Euler Problem 793

Instead of directly calculating the median by listing all elements (would take n^2 time), we do something smarter.

1. First lets sort the set S = {S_0, ... S_{n-1}}

2. Using a binary search let low = S_0*S_1, high = S_{n-2}*S_{n-1}, and m be the middle value, let this m
be our intital guess for the median

    2.1. There are going to be nC2 = n(n - 1)/2 pairwise products and therefore if there are n(n-1)/4 products which are 
    less than m, then m is the median of this set by definition.

    2.2. Therefore, we need loop through the set S only once, which is the crucial part to lower the time complexity,
    Let say we are on element S_i, then we find the maximal element, j, such that S_i*S_j â‰¤ m, we can do this with
    a binary search again in S by using m/S_i
    
        2.2.1 Once we have found j, it means that there will be j - i products which do not exceed m becuase we must
        have that i < j by the problem definition

    2.3 Once we have found the total products less than m, if the number is greater than our goal (n(n-1)/4), then
    we know that this guess is too high, we let high = mid - 1, otherwise, if we have too little then let lo = mid

3. After the binary search we will have found our median
