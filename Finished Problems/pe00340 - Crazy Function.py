Project Euler Problem 340

It is clear that recursion will not work, we need to somehow simplify F(n) and S(n)

Notice that if n in range (b-a, b] then a + n > b, and then we have that 
F(a + n) = a + n - c

Therefore F(n) = F(a + F(a + F(a + a + n - c))) = F(a + F(a + F(2a + n - c))), therefore if a > c then 
2a + n - c > b => F(n) = F(a + F(a + 2a + n - 2c)) = F(a + F(3a + n - 2c)) = 
F(4a + n - 3c) = 4a + n - 4c

Notice in our problem a = 21^7 > 12^7 = c, so that part is fine, but what about numbers in the range
[0, b - a]?

Well notice that if n is in the range (b - 2a, b - a] then we have that a + n is in
the range (b - a, b]!

Therefore we have that F(a + n) = 5a + n - 4c, hence 
F(n) = F(a + F(a + F(a + 5a + n - 4c))) = 8a + n - 7c

Continuing we will get if n is in the range (b - 3a, b - 2a] then a + n is in preceding range, etc, etc
F(n) = 12a + n - 11c, etc, etc

Therefore we conclude:
If n is in the range (b - (k + 1)a, b - ka] k â‰¥ 0, then
F(n) = 4(k + 1)a + n - (3k + 4)c

We can now instantly solve F(n), but summing 7^21 terms will take forever, we need to efficiently compute S(a, b, c)

S(a, b, c) = sum_{n = 0 to b} F(n)
We split this up into the different k values

S(a, b, c) = sum_{k = 0 to b/a} a*(4(k + 1)a - (3k + 4)c) + sum_{n = b - (k + 1)a to b - ka} n
Therefore
S(a, b, c) = sum_{k = 0 to b/a} a*(4(k + 1)a - (3k + 4)c) + 1/2(a + 1)(2ak + a - 2b)

sum_{k = 0 to b/a} a*(4(k + 1)a - (3k + 4)c) = sum_{k = 0 to b/a} 4kaa + 4aa - 3kac - 4ac
