Project Euler Problem 

There are some prime values, p, for which there exists a positive integer, n, such that the expression n^3 + n^2p 
is a perfect cube.

For example, when p = 19, 8^3 + 8^2Ã—19 = 12^3.

What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property the value of n is unique, 
and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.

How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?

Notes:
    
n^3 + n^2p = x^3
n^3 (p/n + 1) = x^3 => n * cbrt(p/n + 1) = x
n * cbrt((p+n)/n) = x => p+n and n must both be perfect cubes

Also note that the largest prime below 1,000,000 is 999,983, and the first occurence where the difference between 2 cubic numbers
is greater than 999,983 is the 578th cubic

So this means for each prime below 1,000,000, we will find a cubic such that n+p is also a cubic

additional notes after solving:
    
n^3 + n^2p = n^2(p+n) = x^3 and we know p+n and n must both be perfect cubes so let n = k^3 and p+n = m^3

then p + n = m^3 = > p = m^3 - k^3 = (m-k)(m^2+mk-k^2) => m-k is a factor of p, but p is prime
therefore m-k = 1 = > m = k+1

p = (k+1)^3 - k^3 so p must be the difference of 2 cubes!
